Utilities to help me with Chinese-language work

 1. `character_count.py`: Count the Chinese characters (only) in a file and return their overall percentages. File to be opened must be in directory `DATA`.

 1. `separate_pinyin/` takes a string of Pīnyīn as input and returns a list of the discrete component syllables. 

 1. `statistics/`: little programs to calculate statistical tests.
