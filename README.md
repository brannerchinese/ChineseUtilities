## ChineseUtilities

Utilities to help me with Chinese-language work and other NLP tasks

 1. `json_texts`: Contains research files in progress, in JSON format. Format specification is at `json_format_for_prosody.txt`. Program `handle_files.py` enables encrypted version of data files to be pushed to repo, but keeps contents private.

 1. `character_count.py`: Count the Chinese characters (only) in a file and return their overall percentages. File to be opened must be in directory `DATA`.

 1. `separate_pinyin/` Takes a string of Pīnyīn as input and returns a list of the discrete component syllables. There is a second program `count_syllables.py` to count the number of syllables found.

 1. `statistics/`: Little programs to calculate statistical tests.

 1. `poetry_flask/`: The beginnings of a web application to assist the study of medieval Chinese prosody.

 1. `hanamin_fonts/`: Copy of the HANAMIN fonts for use with this project.
