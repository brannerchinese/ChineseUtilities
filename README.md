## ChineseUtilities

Utilities to help me with Chinese-language work and other NLP tasks

 1. `character_count.py`: Count the Chinese characters (only) in a file and return their overall percentages. File to be opened must be in directory `DATA`.

 1. `gauge_voice_transcription/`: Quantifies the likeness between two strings of normalized English. Intended for the comparison of an automated voice transcription of an original passage. Requires Python 2.

 1. `separate_pinyin/` Takes a string of Pīnyīn as input and returns a list of the discrete component syllables. There is a second program `count_syllables.py` to count the number of syllables found.

 1. `statistics/`: Little programs to calculate statistical tests.
