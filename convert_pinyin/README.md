## Convert Pinyin

A script to open old Pages files and convert the vowels bearing Pīnyīn-diacritics, in my old Shyrbaw, Longyan, and Pradtino fonts, to standard Unicode.

Program works for v. 8 of Pages; v. 9 and later use a different format and I don't know how to interpret its bytes.

To do: test suite, using known in and out files (see in "reference" directory).
